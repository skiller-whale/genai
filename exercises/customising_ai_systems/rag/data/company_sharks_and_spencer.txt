Sharks and Spencer is one of the oldest companies still operating in the underwater economy. 
Founded in 1884 in Swimchester, its legacy stretches back to the days when financial transactions were still 
done with polished shells and carved driftwood tokens. Over time, the firm transitioned into a full-fledged 
fin-tech giant, but it never lost its roots in the community.

Despite having only a few thousand employees, Sharks and Spencer commands enormous respect. Their 
services include shark-fin insurance, pearl-backed credit cards, and tide-based investment portfolios. 
Generations of sea creatures have trusted the firm to safeguard their treasures, and their iconic vaults 
are said to be impenetrable even to the cleverest octopus.

But cracks in the company’s pristine reputation have begun to show. In 2015, a whistleblower revealed that 
executives had been secretly funding “reef redevelopment projects” that led to the displacement of entire 
seahorse communities. The firm insisted it was an unfortunate oversight, but leaked memos suggested otherwise.

Even with scandals like these, the company remains a pillar of the community. Many underwater citizens 
still say they would rather store their pearls with Sharks and Spencer than risk dealing with flashy newcomers. 
Trust, once earned over centuries, is not so easily lost—even if shadows loom in the background.
