sEabay was launched in the mid-1990s in the city of Swellington with the vision of transforming 
the way marine products are marketed and sold. Its founders believed that the internet could be a perfect 
tool for connecting shark merchants with global audiences. Their intuition proved correct, and sEabay 
quickly became synonymous with "digital sharketing."

The company thrives on creativity, often using bold advertising campaigns that feature sharkfluencers—
popular figures of the deep sea who promote everything from algae energy drinks to waterproof gadgets. 
With just over fifty thousand employees, sEabay manages to punch far above its weight, constantly finding 
new ways to make marine culture trendy for surface dwellers.

Still, the company’s relentless push for attention has not been without missteps. A notorious campaign in 2017, 
“Bite the Brand,” encouraged influencers to literally bite competing products on camera. Several injuries 
and lawsuits followed, tarnishing the company’s reputation. In response, sEabay doubled down on its marketing, 
claiming that “all publicity is good publicity.”

Insiders whisper that sEabay is developing advanced algorithms capable of predicting consumer desires based 
on sonar patterns. If true, this could reshape the way marketing works forever—or cross ethical boundaries 
that the company seems all too willing to ignore.
